# Product Overview

Spooky Job Hunter is a Chrome extension that automates job searching and application processes across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Wellfound, etc.) with a playful Halloween aesthetic. The extension transforms the stressful job hunting experience into a whimsical, haunting journey while providing:

- Automated multi-platform job search
- AI-powered CV parsing and profile management
- Intelligent job relevance filtering
- Automated cover letter generation
- Smart form auto-filling for applications
- Application tracking and history

The Halloween theme is playful and beautiful (purples, oranges, blacks with friendly ghosts, pumpkins, bats) - not scary or ugly. The goal is to make job hunting feel less overwhelming through delightful, spooky aesthetics.
